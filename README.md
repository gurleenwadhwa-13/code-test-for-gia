# Steps taken to build this app.

### Intro:
Thanks Sanjeevi for giving me an opportunity today to speak and learn from you, I am beyond excited to hear back from you regarding this project. Here is the complete info about this project.

I created this app locally and then imported the codebase using Github to be imported into replit. Reason I did this is because I was having alot of intense dependency issues for using external packages like tailwind, shadCN and tanstack tables.

Project hosted on Github: https://github.com/gurleenwadhwa-13/code-test-for-gia

## Steps 1: Setup project using Vites
1. Initialized a React Vite Project locally using `create vite@latest`
2. Selected react and typescript.

## Step 2: Installed Tailwind, ShadCN and Tanstack tables.
1. Installed dependencies like shadCN: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite and with peer-dependency props options.
2. Installed table: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/data-table and figured out what was needed from the wealth of options available.
3. Installed the button, card, checkbox, input, label  using ShadCN.

##### Local Setup: You can run it locally using the following steps:
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

## Uploaded Project to Github to be imported using replit.

I uploaded this project to replit initially but after wasting around 20-30 minutes figuring out dependency issues, I decided to to import my project Github and then sync it into Replit.

## Time Taken: 
- Coding and getting the project done locally: roughly 50-60 minutes.

- I did not use ChatGPT to write any core functionality, just used it to do find the syntax and prop type errors in the DataTable.tsx file (Lines 23-28) and improve the filtering functionality to use LastName and FirstName together.

- Completing the hosting to replit: Another 50 minutes. (A ton of issues faced, attaching my ChatGPT and Grok chats below)

## Final remarks:
I understand this interview wasn't ideal, but I really liked our conversation and hope you would understand why the extra time was taken to finish off this task. Regardless of the decision of this interview, I had a nice chat with you and learned some really insightful things from you, thanks for your kindness by providing me with the extra time and taking this as a take home assignment.
